## Functionality

### Login/Register
The user of the app  are presented with the option to login/register(if the account does not exist in the database). The passwords for the users are hashed before they are stored.

### Home
After logging in, the user is taken to the index page where they can search for books by title, author or ISBN. If the book is found in the database, the user is displayed with information about the book, the past reviews by previous users, an option to add their own review provided they haven't reviewed the same book before.
